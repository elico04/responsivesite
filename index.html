            Aries began producing around late 2012-early 2013 when he was in high school. He didn't know how to play any instruments when he first began his producing career and used rock music as his muse. He would go with his friends and smoke weed with them before freestyling raps with them since this was the music he realized he wanted to make. He stopped smoking after suffering a series of panic attacks resulting in him deciding to sit alone in his room. He learned how to create melodies by himself, not knowing anything about music theory, but making videos and remaking instrumentals of popular songs helped him learn what kind of music he wanted to make, which resulted in him doing what he does today.
